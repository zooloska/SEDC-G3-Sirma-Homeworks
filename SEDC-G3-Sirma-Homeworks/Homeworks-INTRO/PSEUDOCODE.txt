Five important rules for writing pseudocode are:

Write one statement per line.
Initial keywords should be represented in capital case(READ, WRITE, IF, WHILE, UNTIL).
Indentation of pseudocode should be similar to the actual program to show hierarchy.
Ending the multiline structure is necessary.
Keep statements in simple language(English).
